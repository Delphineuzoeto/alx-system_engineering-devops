**Expansions variables shell initialization files alias** Expansions allow for manipulating command arguments and filenames, variables are used to store and retrieve values in Unix-like systems, shell initialization files allow users to customize the shell environment by setting aliases (which are commands that create shortcuts or alternate names for commands in Unix-like systems). /etc/profile allows system-wide configuration of environment variables and aliases. This project is all about mastering the various command lines in the above topics.
